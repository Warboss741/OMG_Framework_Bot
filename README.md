# OMG_Framework_Bot

Bot for the discord server for the FiveM OMG Framework

Users will have to install Node.js, impliment their own bot token into the `tokens.json` file, and install the npm packages "discord.js" and "date-time" in order to use this code

If you do not know how to install Node.js, the npm packages listed, or use the discord developer portal to obtain a bot token, look up what you are going to ask on the internet before opening an issue or asking on this GitHub as both of those actions are covered on the internet in some way, shape or form, and will be ignored on this GitHub

(more information will be provided here as the bot is developed and grows)
